# DHT-Sensor-on-ESP32
This repo contains firmware for DHT sensor with ESP32 for getting the data on both IoT platform (Thing Speak) and Local Serial Monito of PC.

About DHT:-
The DHT sensors are made of two parts, a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor.
There is also a very basic chip inside that does some analog to digital conversion and spits out a digital signal with the temperature and humidity.
The digital signal is fairly easy to read using any microcontroller.

About Think Space:
Think Space is an IoT planform same as AWS and micrsoft etc.
